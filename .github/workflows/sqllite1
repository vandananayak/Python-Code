python embedded sql is sqllite
dowload and install sqllite from https://sqlitebrowser.org/
save it in desktop for easy access
open sqllite once the installation is done
create new database and save in some particular folder. I recommend to put in the place where you have all python files saved
after creating the data base close the window that pops up 
go to execute sql for creating a table

CREATE TABLE users(
name VARCHAAR(128),
email VARCHAR(128)
)
users is the name of the table
within {} you will have attributes or column name
VARCHAR is type for strings
128 is the maximum size for VARCHAR in the disk so you cant put the charecters beyond this number
press the play button to run

go to browse data ->new record
then enter the details name and email..Note you can have any kind of data

we can insert the data using sql statement as well
INSERT INTO users(name,email) VALUES ('bae','bae@gmail.com')
and run in execute sql

to delete a row
DELETE FROM users WHERE email='bae@gmail.com'

to update the row of existing data
UPDATE users set name='charlie' WHERE email='bae@gmail.com'

retrieving the record
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='charlie'
gives the value name and email of charlie
SELECT * FROM users
will give the whole table 

to sort the data
SELECT * from user ORDER BY name
